# 🏠 House Price Prediction with MLOps 🚀

This project demonstrates how a **simple machine learning task**, like predicting house prices, can become **standout-worthy** when built with clean implementation, MLOps principles, and design patterns.

Inspired by a real success story where a student secured a **50 LPA offer** through a similar project, this repository showcases a **production-grade** machine learning pipeline using tools like **MLflow**, **ZenML**, and design principles like **Factory** and **Strategy** patterns.

## 📌 Highlights

- ✅ Full ML pipeline: Data ingestion → EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment
- 🧠 Focus on **understanding data**, not just modeling
- ⚙️ Use of **MLOps tools** like MLflow and ZenML for tracking and automation
- 🧩 **Design Patterns**:
  - **Factory Pattern** for scalable data ingestion and format handling
  - **Strategy Pattern** for modularizing transformation and modeling logic
- 🔁 **CI/CD pipelines** to streamline training → validation → deployment
- 📊 Advanced **EDA and Visualization** for insights
- 🔍 Strong emphasis on **code quality**, structure, and maintainability
- 🧪 Model versioning and logging with MLflow UI
## 🧪 Model Building & Training

- Used multiple regression algorithms with a focus on **Linear Regression**
- Implemented **feature scaling**, **log transformations**, and **cross-validation**
- Tracked each run using **MLflow tracking UI**
- Built versioned model registry with **deployment-ready endpoints**

---

## 📦 Deployment

- Deployment handled via **MLflow Deployer** and **ZenML Inference Services**
- Prediction service integrates easily with **Streamlit UI** or **REST APIs**
- Supports **continuous deployment pipelines** with model retraining triggers
